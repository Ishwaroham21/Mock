A man faced strict action for obstructing an ambulance in Thrissur, Kerala, as his driving licence was revoked and a fine of Rs 2.5 lakh imposed. The incident occurred on November 7, in Chalakudy, where an ambulance travelling from Ponnani to Thrissur Medical College was denied the right of way.

A video captured and shared by paramedics showed a silver Maruti Suzuki Ciaz car deliberately blocking the ambulance for over two minutes on a two-lane road. Despite the ambulance driver honking persistently and the siren blaring, the car driver repeatedly manoeuvred to obstruct any attempts to overtake.

Authorities identified the driver using the vehicle’s registration plate and initiated legal action. The driver was charged under several sections of the Motor Vehicles Act, including failure to yield to an emergency vehicle, obstructing an authorised authority’s functions, and not carrying a valid Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC).

The fine amount includes penalties for multiple violations, reflecting the seriousness of obstructing emergency services. According to Section 194E of the Motor Vehicles Act, refusing to give way to an ambulance can lead to imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of Rs 10,000, or both.

The Kerala Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) reiterated that ensuring ambulances receive a clear path is a legal and moral responsibility. Officials emphasised that such actions delay critical medical assistance and can endanger lives.
